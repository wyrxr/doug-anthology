The success of Donations, Death Road, and Dogs: An Anthology of Critical Douglas Studies blindsided the culture upon its publication. The editors were among those most surprised by its meteoric rise to fame, and we were not prepared for the subsequent influx of critical letters from such a broad population of readers. What was once a primarily academic discipline that worked quietly in the shadows has been thrust into the role of ambassador for the Academy itself. Douglas Studies has been variously called "the worst excesses of academic onanism," "an incomprehensible collection of meaningless jargon," and "the only thing really worth talking about right now." 

To those who have voiced their support, we owe all our gratitude. Your rays of sunlight have made these recent storms bearable. To the students who have dutifully reported every typo and grammatical mistake, we genuinely wonder whether you had anything better to do. Nevertheless, these typos have been retained as an exercise for the reader. 

The Second Edition in general remains exactly the same as the First Edition. To those wondering whether you can then just buy a used copy of the First Edition for your class, no, you cannot. The page numbers have been shifted by an undisclosed amount, making your assignments impossible to complete without the correct edition.
