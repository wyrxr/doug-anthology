The subsequent article was received as a cassette tape with the above title attached. The editors have transcribed it to the best of their abilities. The first voice appears to be Mr. Gregory, while the other voices remain unidentified. They have been labelled for the reader's convenience.

**Lucien**: [clears throat] Ah, crap I gotta get this in by tomorrow. What did I have in mind? Oh, right. As I've argued before:

>An artist is identical with an anarchist.^[The editors note that this monologue appeared previously in Chesterton's *The Man Who Was Thursday* and have cited it as such, despite Mr. Gregory's protestations.] You might transpose the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man who throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment to everything. He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light, one peal of perfect thunder, than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen. An artist disregards all governments, abolishes all conventions. The poet delights in disorder only. If it were not so, the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway. Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will tell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for, that place they will reach. It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh, their eyes like stars and their souls—

**Slavonj**: Disgusting!

**Lucien**: [continuing] Their souls again in Eden...

**Slavonj**: Filthy, disgusting! 

**Lucien**: Filthy? I'll have you know it is a very well-laundered speech. Hm... Of course! Now I have lost my train of thought...

**Slavonj**: Here, perhaps... [the sound of metal clanking and rustling paper] Indeed— [sniffles] *This* is true ideology!

**Kerm**: We can't eat *that*.

**Slavonj**: What is a trash can? It's an object shaped by *ideology*. What is it for? It is the situation-product, a receptacle for society's detritus. We fill it in with this so-called "trash" and so it acquires such a reputation. But what if we empty the object of its ideology? We empty the trash can and place in it something valuable. Does it become trash? It depends on how willing you are to dig through this trash, to tolerate its smell, and so on...

**Kerm**: Can you, though? Y'know, there's *rules*...

**Slavonj**: So you say. Because, because— It's a hideous thing, I don't even want to talk about it. But we are really haunted by this specter, this image of a "trash man" who will come and steal from us this "trash" which we have just newly found to be valuable. This is the violence of the oppressive classes. 

**Kerm**: Will you *stop* throwing things on the ground? This place is already filthy. Please, just help me clean this up. A disordered environment leads to a disordered mind. *I* can hardly think after looking around. The tragedy of the commons on full display. This is exactly why we need hierarchy and not any of that Marxist *nonsense*. The biological-anthropological data are clear, they're all around us! Indeed, you make a clean division between an exploitative "trash man" and an exploited "trash recoverer," but the situation is not so clear-cut. Perhaps the trash man is being exploited too by having to bare all of society's burdensome trash. Trash is indeed a very natural concept. Even fish and birds can identify and remove trash from their environment. 

**Slavonj**: Mm, yes. The bird clears out his spot, plucks out all his unwanted sticks, and then he makes his nest out of my discarded condom wrapper, no? Why not? He will pluck the colorful papers and strings we throw away to impress upon the female birds his sexual potency, his vital energy. 

**Kerm**: [pause] What's that?

**Slavonj**: Oh, I don't know. It appears to be a brick-shaped mug. Precisely. This is precisely my point. Do you see it? There is no drinking hole. It is a brick that cannot be used as a brick and a mug that cannot be used as a mug. Pure excess without obligation. [sniff]

**Kerm**: Excessive, yes. And *useless*. Who would make such a thing? This is exactly the kind of product a proper business manager would avoid making. The other day I had seen—see, it was on a TV in a store window—but it was the most absurd thing. It was just a live-streamed video of a chair in a hot tub. That was it! But there they were, tens of thousands of people watching this chair just... *sit there*! 

**Slavonj**: This is because it's his *seat*, his chair, that gives the streamer authority. He's given that authority from the viewers, you see. The seat already had all the power, all the potential, and it was the streamer who used that power and authority to project his persona. [snort] The chair stream asks the question, "What if we do not need the streamer at all?" It's the true proletariat uprising, the real worker-consumers rising to their proper place. What is a show without its audience? Nothing. So indeed, the logical conclusion is that we turn off the television and gaze into the mirror instead! Then we shall see the *objet petit a*...
