 An essay about a fictionalized "Zoom Cat Lawyer" situation. However, in this situation a real lawyer appears as a cat, and people on the Internet create a meme about the (fictional) real lawyer being the cat with a "human filter." This trolling causes real-world issues for the lawyer, who must navigate a world where deliveries of cat food arrive at his doorstep and his business partners receive emails asking whether there are any laws saying a cat can't be a lawyer. The essay explores the ethics of Internet memes when they intersect with the world, and how the memes celebrated in one sphere can have real consequences in another sphere.
