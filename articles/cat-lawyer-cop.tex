\emph{Originally assumed to be a misrouted submission to The Bare Ass
Review, this provocative article provides an idiosyncratic perspective
into a truly bizarre situation. Despite roving far beyond the usual

\noindent As Jimothy Douglas awoke one morning from noisome dreams, he
found himself in his bed transformed into a slanderous vermin. Yesterday
had been a normal day, as normal as a day could be during a global
pandemic. He had eaten breakfast (eggs and toast), read the newspaper,
read the new motion submitted by the prosecution, and had helped his son
set up his laptop for school. The idea still left a sour taste in his
mouth---kids needed face-to-face interaction, after all!---but he didn't
know of any viable alternatives, so he started writing out a response to
the other party's motion while his son squinted distractedly at his tiny
teacher gesticulating from the glowing laptop.

Mr.~Douglas looked at the clock on his wall with anxious anticipation,
going over in his head the exact sequence for the day's events: School,
copy over brief notes to laptop, prepare for his appearance before the
court. The timeline would be tight, but it provided him just enough time
to get everything in order before appearing on camera. His son's gaming
laptop was the only computer in the house which could run the streaming
software that the whole world now depended upon, meaning it became a
logistical nightmare trying to juggle between him, his son, and his
wife. His Windows 98 PC that had served him valiantly for his entire
career had finally reached the end of its usefulness, and with deep
reluctance Mr.~Douglas ordered two new laptops which matched the
streaming software's minimum requirements.

What he didn't anticipate was those same laptops getting stuck on a
container ship which decided serendipitously to wedge itself into the
banks of the Suez Canal. His family's logistical nightmares had proved
strangely infectious. Before the disintegrating state of the world could
manifest in his mind as a fully-formed headache, he took a deep breath
and glanced at the clock one more time. Several hours had elapsed, and
his son pressed the laptop into his hands with an awkward forcefulness
before running off to watch TV. He opened it up, wincing at the grimy
crackle coming from its hinges. He blew the crumbs off the keyboard and
began to type. \scenebreak  The alarm on his phone rang. He polished off
his last lingering thought, then reviewed his notes for any remaining
insight that could salvage his shaky case. The the facts and the law had
a habit
